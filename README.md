# Clustering
This project involves implementing the K-Means and K-Medoids clustering algorithms from scratch to analyze a dataset of sports cars, focusing on attributes like horsepower, acceleration, and engine size. The purpose was to explore clustering methods on real-world data, compare the results, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches.

Through this project, I learned how to preprocess data, visualize clusters, and evaluate the results using metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index. K-Means proved to be more efficient but sensitive to outliers, while K-Medoids offered more stable results at the cost of higher computational demands.

For the implementation, I used Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualizing the clusters, and Scikit-learn to evaluate the results.

Overall, the project successfully highlighted key differences between the two algorithms, though K-Medoids required more time and computational power to run effectively on larger datasets.

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link:
[Sports Car Prices Dataset

Once downloaded, place the cars.csv file in a data folder within the project directory to run the code successfully.
